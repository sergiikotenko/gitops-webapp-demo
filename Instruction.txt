ArgoCD: https://a8ba5163d4eb946c185e500a0a445dea-1780875540.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com/applications/web-app-dev
GH  Actions: https://github.com/sergiikotenko/gitops-webapp-demo/actions

gitops-webapp-demo (main)$:
	k apply -f argocd.yaml (expected result - new projects are created)
	check GH Action (expected result: build and deploy are OK)
	Check ArgoCD (expected result: new image are delivered to the k8s)


Open question:
 - [/] divide application into 2 parts - application and gitops (k8s config files, kustomize etc)
  - [/] git@github.com:sergiikotenko/gitops-infra-demo.git k8s base files
  - 
 - How to promote image to another environment - via pull request?
 - similar ENV_VARS with different values
